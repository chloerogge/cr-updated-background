    Hello, my name is Chloe Rogge!

        <p> This is my first year at MNSU, however, it is my third year of college. I am a transfer student from MSU-Moorhead, where I did two years in the graphic design program. Unfortunately, they decided to make major changes and cuts within the program, which caused me to make the tough choice to move to Mankato. I moved here in August and quickly fell in love with the campus, my professors, and the town which reinforced my choice all the more. I am so happy here and so many fabulous doors have been opened as a result of other doors closing behind me.    </p>

        As far as school goes, I plan to graduate next spring with my BFA in Graphic Design and a concentration in Printmaking (which has absolutely captured my heart!). Where I’ll end up after that? Who knows! Something I love about the design world is that it is ever-changing and so versatile. I have many things I would like to do in life and I feel as though I just might do all of them. <b>However, if I had to choose a dream career path, it would be tattooing.</b> It is something that captivates me. I love getting them, looking at them, and creating for others, so I think it is a job I would love and never be bored of. I have high hopes of finding an apprenticeship one day, probably after I graduate and have a little more time! I would also love to write and illustrate a children’s book at some point. That has always been a goal of mine for many years now. I think that the perfect opportunities will come together just as they’re supposed to, that’s how it always seems to work out for me! If I had to pick a more easily accessible job in the design field, I think I would love working for a brewery or creative magazine. :-)

      When I am not doing school stuff and working, there are many things I like to occupy my time with. They include:
        
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Cooking in my #tinyasskitchen (a series I have developed for myself on my social media platforms </li>
            <li> Designing and shipping orders for my small business that I run on Etsy selling my artwork in sticker, keychain, and pin form (I also have work in a store called Union Market in Mankato, which was a huge blessing that came with moving here), you can view my Etsy store at <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/ChloeRoggeDesign"> Chloe Rogge Design </a> </li>
            <li> Painting, watercolor to be exact</li>
            <li> Going to breweries with my sweet boyfriend</li>
            <li> Thrifting for fun new pieces for my home and closet</li>
            <li>  Being a dedicated plant mom and dog mom to my boyfriend’s pup, Axel</li>
        
        
        </ul>
